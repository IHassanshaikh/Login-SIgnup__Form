# Login/SIgnup__Form
 I have created login and sign-up form replicas for his university using MongoDB as the database. To ensure robust security, he integrated multiple key packages into the project:  bcryptjs: Used for hashing passwords, ensuring that stored passwords are encrypted and secure. cookie-parser: Utilized to manage cookies, making it easier to handle user sessions and maintain a secure, authenticated state. dotenv: Employed to manage environment variables, keeping sensitive information like API keys and database credentials secure. jsonwebtoken: Used for generating and verifying tokens, enabling secure user authentication and authorization. This combination of tools provides a strong foundation for user authentication, ensuring that the application is both secure and scalable.
